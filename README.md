News app
==================================

This app was made by following and mixing tutorials from the android basic compose course https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course


This app demonstrated the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to
handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images by URL.
This app uses Room library to easily create and use relational databases in an Android app.
