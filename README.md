# News app
This app was made by following and mixing tutorials from the Android Basics Compose course:  
https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course

This app demonstrates the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images by URL.  
It also uses the Room library to easily create and use relational databases in an Android app.
